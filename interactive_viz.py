st.markdown("""Inclusionary Zoning (IZ), a policy requiring home developers to reserve units for low-income households, speaks to a broader, fundamental divide between liberal and conservative voters. In theory, the policy would be popular among liberals who tend to favor government intervention that increases the amount affordable housing and reduces results of gentrification. Alternatively, the policy would be unpopular among conservatives who tend to vote for increased property rights and the deregulation of the market. 
            
This distinction produced opposite poll results. Of all Harris voters polled, **35%** believe IZ decreases housing costs while **23%** believe it increases housing costs. Contrarily, **37%** of all Trump voters polled believe IZ increases housing costs while only **24%** believe it decreases housing costs. The remainder of each voter base is either *Not sure* of the effects of IZ or believe it will *Have no impact on housing costs*. A politician appealing to the supermajority would be wise to avoid making IZ a center point of their platform and should instead focus on more universally accepted policies like requiring local governments to approve projects that meet predetermined standards or making permits easier to acquire.

These results are encapsulated by a horizontal grouped bar graph displaying question results for Harris and Trump voters side-by-side to highlight similarities and differences in perception. Each group is distinguished intuitively by its candidate‚Äôs respective party color. A title, axis labels, and a legend clarify the data and the meaning of each response. A citation was also included. The graph itself is interactive and easily shareable, courtesy of the Streamlit Community Cloud, to increase engagement. This also allows the exact percentages to be displayed by hovering over each bar and gives users the option to isolate the results by toggling the legend.""")
